Cricket is a sport that contains a lot of statistical data. There is data about batting records, bowling records, individual player records, scorecard of different matches played, etc. This data can be put to proper use to predict the results of games and so this problem has become an interesting problem in todayâ€™s world. Most of viewers nowadays try to do some sort of prediction at some stage of the tournaments to see which team will eventually win the upcoming matches and thereby the tournament. This report aims at solving the problem of predicting the results of games by identifying the important attributes from the data set and using the data mining algorithms. I have limited my area of study to the domestic Twenty 20 tournament which is held in India every year during the summer i.e. the Indian Premier League. The previous work that I read and used as a reference were either predicting game results for all sports in general or sports like Basketball, Soccer, etc. My report describes in detail the different attribute selection techniques as well as the data mining algorithms used to solve this problem of result prediction in cricket. I have also used accuracy as the evaluation criteria to evaluate how well the prediction performs. Some future work is also suggested in this report in case some other student in the future is interested in continuing the study of this problem and improving upon my results
